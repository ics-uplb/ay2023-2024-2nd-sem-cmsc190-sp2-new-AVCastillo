#My Special Problem: UPLB ARMS: QR Code-based Attendance Recording and Monitoring System
Authors: Adams Vincent R. Castillo and Asst. Prof Rizza D. Mercado

Digitalization has revolutionized many traditional processes, including attendance tracking in educational institutions. This study aims to develop a mobile-friendly digital attendance recording and monitoring system for the 
University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB). The system utilizes QR code technology to streamline the attendance process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming for both students and instructors. The developed web 
application allows students to record their attendance by scanning a QR code provided by the instructor, thereby freeing up valuable class time for lectures and discussions. Instructors benefit from automated attendance logging 
and monitoring, reducing their administrative burden. Additionally, the system enables students to monitor their own attendance records, helping them avoid the consequences of excessive absences.
